A hierarchical real-time motion planning framework is proposed for dual-arm collaboration in dynamic environments. The framework integrates a centralized, optimization-based global planner with two distributed local reactive planners, enabling real-time adjustments of both long-horizon trajectories and local motion behaviors to effectively avoid moving obstacles. The framework was implemented on ROS platform and validated through dual-arm simulations and experiments.

This is an interdisciplinary research project co-advised by Prof. [Chuxiong Hu](https://me.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1275/2062.htm) and Prof. [Xining Zang](https://me.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1280/1923.htm). We proposed a Direct Ink Writing and Tar-Mediated Laser Sintering (DIW-TMLS) process and developed the corresponding equipment, enabling rapid fabrication of refractory metal patterns in ambient air. The DIW-TMLS process can create conformal circuits on 3D curvilinear surfaces and even produce 3D freestanding architectures. In addition, a molybdenum-patterned wireless sensor is demonstrated, which capable of withstanding temperature up to 350Â°C and exposure to flames.

This is an extension of my undergraduate thesis. Contouring error is an important performance index for five-axis machine tools. An efficient numerical algorithm is designed for synchronized estimation of both tool tip and tool orientation contouring errors in five-axis machine tools, which is capable of operating in real-time at a frequency of 5000 Hz. In addition, an iterative contouring error compensation scheme with theoretical guarantee of convergence is proposed. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed scheme can effectively reduce contouring errors in extreme contours with large curvatures and sharp corners.

This project is supported by the National Training Program of Innovation and Entrepreneurship for Undergraduates, under the supervision of Assoc. Prof. [Dongchao Yang](https://me.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1276/1950.htm). We designed a gait planning algorithm for quadruped robots based on modulated Central Pattern Generator (CPG) network. The algorithm is verified on a self-developed quadruped robot prototype. In addition, we designed a leg admittance control strategy that enables compliant walking on slopes.
