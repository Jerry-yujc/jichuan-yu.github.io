## About Me
<br>
<img src="images/portrait.jpg" class="floatpic2">

Here is **Jichuan Yu (于济川)**, you can also call me **Jerry**.


I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Mechanical Engineering](https://me.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) at Tsinghua University, under the supervision of Prof. [Chuxiong Hu](https://me.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1275/2062.htm). I got my bachelor degree in Mechanical Engineering at Tsinghua University in 2021.

I have a broad interest in motion planning and control for advanced mechatronic systems, such as manipulators and CNC machines. I am dedicated to empowering mechatronic systems with greater intelligence through innovative algorithms, enabling them to serve humankind more effectively.

My current research focuses on optimization-based coordinated motion planning for dual-arm robotic systems. Dual-arm robotic systems can mimic human arms to perform more complex tasks collaboratively. However, their higher dimensionality and more complicated constraints, such as inter-arm collisions and the kinematic coordination of end effectors, pose greater challenges to motion planning, which is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem. My research aims to develop an efficient method to solve such a problem. I'm also working on designing a real-time motion planning framework that enables dual-arm robotic systems to operate efficiently and safely in dynamic environments. 

Prior to this, I have also worked on some interesting projects, such as laser-assisted 3D printing. More details can be found in the [research](/research/index.html) section.
